### What Is a Code Kata?
A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps programmers hone their skills through practice. A code kata is usually set up as a series of unit tests, which fail. Your task is to write code to make them pass. The idea is inspired by the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts. Just like in the martial arts, you can repeat a kata multiple times to make improvements to your solutions.
